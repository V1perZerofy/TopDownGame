# Whispers of the Hollow — Narrative Document

## Intro Story

For centuries, the Hollow was believed to be a myth—an island that appears on no map, hidden by cursed tides and storm-filled skies. You, a cartographer's apprentice, were aboard an exploration vessel when a sudden maelstrom struck.

When you awaken, you’re alone on a moss-covered shoreline. Your compass spins wildly. Time feels warped.

The only clue? A glowing sigil etched into a nearby stone:

> "Only those who listen to the Hollow will escape it."

With nothing but your wits and a salvaged blade, you set out into the dense fog...

## Setting & World

**The Hollow** is a mysterious, forgotten island that exists outside of known time and space. It’s filled with:

- Strange anomalies that warp physics and logic

Each biome (ruins, caves, altars, forests) has its own aesthetic and narrative fragments.
